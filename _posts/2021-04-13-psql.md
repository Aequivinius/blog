Starting work on a new project, and trying to remember how to deal with `psql`:
* `psql -l` to list existing databases
* `psql -d database` to connect to it, `\c database` to connect to other database, `\dt` to list tables etc.
* `rake db:schema:load test` (to create `schema.rb` in `test` environment and database)
