Started a new project, where I need to be loading some patient data from a database dump. Below a short summary how to install PostgreSQL and deal with it.

# Installing and creating databases on OSX

Easiest to install and launch with `brew`:

```
brew doctor && brew update
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
```
üí° Likewise, use `stop` and `restart` to change service status. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Installing `postgresql` comes with lots of helpers: `initdb` creates a database cluster, which is a collection of databases managed by one server, that is, your `postgresql` installation. Then there's the self-explanatory `createdb`, and finally `psql`, which gives you lots of backslashed shorthands for manipulating your databases.

`initdb` checks the environment variable `PGDATA` to know where to create the directories that will store all the data of the databases. On OSX, it is `/usr/local/var/postgres` by default; and by removing this directory and running the following, you can set up a new cluster:

```
mv /usr/local/var/postgres /usr/local/var/postgres.bkp
export PGDATA=/usr/local/var/postgres
initdb --locale en_US.UTF-8
createdb benzaiten
```

üí° You can change the locale for the individual databases, but this will set the default `template1` from which all databases are created to `en_US.UTF-8`.

To create more superusers, use `psql` and then `CREATE ROLE test_role LOGIN SUPERUSER`.

# `psql`

`psql -l` lists available databases, `psql -d database [-U user]` connects to a database, and allows the running of SQL queries as well as some shorthand commands:
* `\dt` to list tables and `\du` for all users
* `\i file` to run SQL commands from a file
* `\q` to quit 

üßπ `rake db:schema:load test` (to create `schema.rb` in `test` environment and database)

# `pgAdmin`

To connect to `pgAdmin`, select `add server` and enter the default values:
